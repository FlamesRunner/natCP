A free open source OpenVZ panel.

##Screenshots

Coming soon.

##Slave node installation

Installing natCP on a slave node is easy.
Log on as the root user, and execute the following command:

    cd /tmp && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlamesRunner/natCP/master/slave/slaveInstall.sh --no-check-certificate
    bash /tmp/slaveInstall.sh

That's it. Make sure you save the slave access key, though!

##Host node installation

Coming soon.
